## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from Unicorn, a family-owned e-commerce platform offering diverse products such as books, office supplies, clothing, electronics, and household items. The goal was to assess sales trends, identify strengths and weaknesses, and uncover growth opportunities to support data-driven decision-making.

## Key Insights

### Sales

- Peak sales occurred every September, followed by a dip in October and a spike in Q4.  
- The Western region led in sales; furniture and technology were top categories.  
- The Consumer segment had the highest sales but fluctuated more, while Corporate showed steady growth.

### Profit
- Profit grew slowly from 2015–2017, then dropped by 6% in 2018, totaling $77K.  
- Technology was the highest-performing category; Furniture showed weak profit, especially in the Central region.  
- Consumer segment profit declined by 21% in 2018; Home Office and Corporate segments showed slight growth.  
- Profit margins varied significantly across different shipping methods.

### Orders

- The Central region had the highest average discount (28%) and the lowest profit, indicating over-discounting negatively impacted margins.

## Recommendations
- **Seasonal Strategy:** Prepare marketing and inventory ahead of Q3/Q4 sales peaks, especially September.  
- **Regional Focus:** Invest in West and East regions; reassess Central region (notably Texas and Illinois) to curb losses.  
- **Product Optimization:** Scale Technology category; improve Furniture performance, focusing on low-profit areas.  
- **Shipping Strategy:** Promote Standard Class shipping; evaluate Same Day delivery efficiency.  
- **Discount Management:** Reduce excessive discounting in the Central region; align discounts with regional and product performance.  
- **Targeted Growth:** Focus on high-sales but low-profit states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina; replicate New York City’s success.
